# Java-notes

A collection of the notes I made when I self-learnt Java over the course of ~3-4 weeks.

Up until this point, the only programming language I had used was Python (and SQL if you count that as a programming langauge). In these notes, you will see me draw several parallels between Java and Python to help me understand things I wasn't quite familar with.
