# Java-notes

A collection of the notes I made when I self-learnt Java over the course of ~3-4 weeks.

Up until this point, the only programming languages I had used were Python and SQL. In these notes, you will see me draw several parallels between Java and Python to help me understand things I wasn't quite familar with.
Also, these notes are in kind of a mess and are completely unordered.
